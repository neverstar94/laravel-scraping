                    <h5>We all like to take a gaze in our refrigerator. Sous answers the common question “what should I eat?” by providing a virtual glance at your fridge while presenting a catalog of what you can make with each ingredient.
                    We are aiming to reduce wasted food by providing recipes that are relevant to the user’s unique food inventory.<h5>
